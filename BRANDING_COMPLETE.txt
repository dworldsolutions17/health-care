📋 FINAL STEP: Add Your Logo
================================

Your website has been fully rebranded with:
✅ New colors: Primary #1767C3, Secondary #21A85A
✅ Company name: "The Health Orbit"
✅ Tagline: "A Lifetime Global Ecosystem"
✅ All components updated

📌 TO COMPLETE THE SETUP:

1. Save the logo image (the one you provided) as:
   
   public/logo.png
   
   (Right-click the logo image → Save as → name it "logo.png" → save in the "public" folder)

2. The logo is already integrated in:
   - Header navigation
   - Favicon (browser tab icon)
   - All branding

3. After saving the logo, run:
   
   npm run build
   
4. Then test locally:
   
   npm run dev
   
5. When ready, deploy to your VPS server

That's it! Your rebranded website will be complete! 🎉
